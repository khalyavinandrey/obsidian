Events flow unidirectionally through a series of processing stages linked by topics, <u>each one performing a mapping operation before publishing a transformed event to the next topic</u>. Intermediate stages simultaneously act as both consumers and producers, and may scale autonomously and independently of one another to match their unique load demands. By breaking a complex problem into stages, SEDA improves the modularity of the system.
