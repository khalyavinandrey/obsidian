An alternate way of increasing consumer throughput, without widening the topic or scaling the consumer group, is to exploit parallelism within the consumer process. This can be achieved by partitioning the workload among a pool of threads by independently hashing the record keys to maintain local order. This strategy would be classed as vertical scaling, requiring increased parallelism on each consumer node in exchange for reducing the number of consumers, and hence the number of partitions.
