The use of commitAsync() makes it possible to process multiple batches before the effects of committing the first are reflected on the brokers, increasing the window of uncommitted records. And while this will lead to a greater number of replayed records following partition reassignment, this behaviour is still consistent with the concept of at-least-once delivery. Using the blocking commitSync() variant reduces the number of uncommitted records to the in-flight batch at the expense of throughput. <u>Unless the cost of processing a record is very high, the asynchronous commit model is generally preferred.</u>
