• A totally ordered set is a special case of a partially ordered set, where there exists a well-defined order between every conceivable element pair. 
• An unordered set is also a special case of a partially ordered set, where there is no pair of comparable elements. 
• Causal order is a rendition of partial order, where each element represents an event, and some pairs of events have a happened-before relationship. 
• On its own, the term ‘ordered set’ is ambiguous, suggesting that the elements of a set exhibit some order-inducing relationships. This term is generally avoided.
