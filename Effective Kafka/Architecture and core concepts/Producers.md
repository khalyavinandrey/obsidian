A Kafka producer is a client application that can act as a source of data in a Kafka cluster. A producer communicates with the cluster over a set of persistent TCP connections, with an individual connection established with each broker. Producers can publish records to one or more Kafka topics, and any number of producers can append records to the same topic. Generally speaking, only producers are allowed to append records to topics; a consumer cannot modify a topic in any way.
