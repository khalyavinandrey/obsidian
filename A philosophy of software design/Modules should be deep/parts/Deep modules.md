The best modules are those that provide powerful functionality yet have simple interfaces

The area of each rectangle is proportional to the functionality implemented by the module. The top edge of a rectangle represents the moduleâ€™s interface; the length of that edge indicates the complexity of the interface.
The best modules are deep: they have a lot of functionality hidden behind a simple interface
A deep module is a good abstraction because only a small fraction of its internal complexity is visible to its users
The best modules are those with the greatest benefit and the least cost
