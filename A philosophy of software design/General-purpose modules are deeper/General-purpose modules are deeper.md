[[Make classes somewhat general-purpose]]
[[General-purpose modules are deeper]]

> General-purpose interfaces have many advantages over special-purpose ones. They tend to be simpler, with fewer methods that are deeper. They also provide a cleaner separation between classes, whereas special-purpose interfaces tend to leak information between classes. Making your modules somewhat generalpurpose is one of the best ways to reduce overall system complexity.
