[[Complexity is incremental]]

> Complexity comes from an accumulation of dependencies and obscurities. As complexity increases, it leads to change amplification, a high cognitive load, and unknown unknowns. As a result, it takes more code modifications to implement each new feature. In addition, developers spend more time acquiring enough information to make the change safely and, in the worst case, they canâ€™t even find all the information they need. The bottom line is that complexity makes it difficult and risky to modify an existing code base.
