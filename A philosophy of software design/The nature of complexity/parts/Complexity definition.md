> Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system

> If a software system is hard to understand and modify, then it is complicated; if it is easy to understand and modify, then it is simple.

> In a complex system, it takes a lot of work to implement even small improvements. In a simple system, larger improvements can be implemented with less effort.

> If a system has a few parts that are very complicated, but those parts almost never need to be touched, then they donâ€™t have much impact on the overall complexity of the system.

> Complexity is more apparent to readers than writers. If you write a piece of code and it seems simple to you, but other people think it is complex, then it is complex

> Your job as a developer is not just to create code that you can work with easily, but to create code that others can also work with easily.
